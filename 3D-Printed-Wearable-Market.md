One of the main drivers for the 3D printed wearables market is a preference of customers to get uniquely designed products. 3D printing allows companies to design a device to perfectly fit an individual?s size or requirements. This would make manufacturing easy along with making the product more appealing to the customer. Another driver can be the focus on health by both consumer technology companies and the general public. For example, 3D printing can be used by sports manufacturers to create shoe soles which enhance a diabetic?s sensory perception. This could enable them to walk more comfortably and they would also be custom designed for each patient. Currently, there is a greater pressure put on manufacturers by both customers as well as the government to be environmentally and socially conscious. 3D printing enables them to save on transportation cost and also dramatically reduces their carbon footprint. While the 3D printed wearables market is still a niche market, it is expected to play an ever-increasing role in the years to come.
